# project-VR
project for the VR class

The game was inspired by the dreams one cannot explain.
It consists of moving a robot (with i,o,p,k,l,m keys) avoiding planets rotating around the sun.

The source code of the project needs the files in the repository src, textures and objects as well as the file gl-matric-min.js
The slides for the project are also present.
The report is the file project_VR.pdf
